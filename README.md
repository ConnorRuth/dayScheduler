This is what the whole schedule looks like between 5-5:59. Beneath the title,"Work Day Scheduler", you will see the current time to the minutes mark.
On the right hand side of each text area there is a save button for that textarea. When saved it will be saved to the devices local storage.
At the very bottom you have the red clear button which will clear the any saved data and empty all the text areas so that the user can start a fresh new day.
